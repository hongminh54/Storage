# ========================================
# ANIMATION CHARACTERISTICS
# ========================================

# DNA_HELIX:
# - Creates realistic double helix structure
# - Cross-links appear every 8 ticks
# - Height: 4 blocks, smooth rotation
# - Best for: Scientific/medical themes, success effects

# GALAXY:
# - 4 spiral arms rotating slowly
# - Particles follow curved paths
# - Slight vertical wave motion
# - Best for: Magical themes, processing effects

# TORNADO:
# - Starts wide at bottom, narrows at top
# - Height: 4 blocks, fast rotation
# - Creates realistic vortex effect
# - Best for: Power themes, dramatic effects

# LIGHTNING:
# - Zigzag pattern with random offsets
# - Only triggers every 15 ticks (performance)
# - 8 segments, 3 blocks height
# - Best for: Failure effects, dramatic moments

# GEOMETRIC_STAR:
# - 5-pointed star with connecting lines
# - Rotates slowly around center
# - Flat pattern (no height variation)
# - Best for: Achievement effects, decorative

# ========================================
# USAGE TIPS
# ========================================

# 1. Start with low particle counts and increase gradually
# 2. Test on your server during peak hours to check performance
# 3. Lightning animation has built-in performance optimization
# 4. Radius 1.5-2.5 works best for most animations
# 5. Speed 0.05-0.3 provides good visual without being too fast
# 6. Duration 2-4 seconds is optimal for most effects
# 7. Combine different animations for multi-stage effects
# 8. Consider your server theme when choosing particle types
